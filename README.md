## Development installation

The following steps are not required to be made for contribute to the project, although it will ensure that your solution environment is compatible with our test/production environment.

### 1. Setup the development environment (virtual machine)

  1. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
  2. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
  3. Install [ChefDK](https://downloads.chef.io/chef-dk/)
  4. Install [vagrant-omnibus](https://github.com/chef/vagrant-omnibus):

    ```
    $ vagrant plugin install vagrant-omnibus
    ```

  5. Install the nfs server:
  
    ```
    $ sudo apt-get install nfs-kernel-server
    ```

  6. Clone the project with `git clone`
  7. `cd` into the project folder and run:

    ```
    $ berks vendor cookbooks
    ```

  8. Bring the VM up (it's gonna take a while):

    ```
    $ vagrant up
    ```

Virtual machine should be up and running.

Open a SSH connection with the virtual machine by running:

    $ vagrant ssh

### 2. Bundle

In the virtual machine, run:

    $ bundle install

### 3. Database setup

In the virtual machine, run:

    $ cp config/database.example.yml config/database.yml
    $ bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate
    $ bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate RACK_ENV=test

## Run the tests

Run the tests to check if everything is working:

    $ bundle exec rspec

## Run the server

Run:

    bundle exec foreman start

to start the server.

Check that it is working by opening a browser in the host machine and pointing it to [http://localhost:3000].

[http://localhost:3000]: http://localhost:3000
